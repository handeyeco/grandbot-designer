# Grandbot Designer

Just a silly site to help me design expressions for [Grandbot](https://github.com/handeyeco/Grandbot).

The binary output might not match your device. I'm using the Max7219 which wants the decimal point (DP) to be the first bit in the byte.

You don't have to keep track of the number in binary - you can use decimal or hexadecimal. I just like using binary because it helps me visualize what the final output will look like.
